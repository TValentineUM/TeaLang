# TeaLang

Implementation of TeaLang frontend and interpreter


Tbh this repository isn't super great, in hindsight there is a lot of stuff that could have been improved or done better however this was developed in the context of a time enclosed assignment.

No sane person should implement a hand lexer or parser for their language unless its suuuper needed for performance but it was in the spec so.

For the latest version look at the branch for Tealang2, it might have some usefull snippets.
